  `So what makes me, me? What sets me apart from the dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of other candidates that are vying for the same position as I am? I could tell you that my experience as a college athlete taught me the importance of working together to make a cohesive team, or how my mechanical engineering degree taught me to learn how to approach problems methodically and thoughtfully, or even how my desire to be a part of the Knotel engineering team, despite having limited experience with coding, shows just how hard I’m willing to work for something. None of that, though, is truly unique to me. Surely, there are others who were college athletes, majored in something other than computer science, or switched fields.`,
  `What makes me, me is that I am tenacious. I  don't back down from a challenge. I didn’t when I competed at the 2012 Snowboarding Nationals; I didn’t when I had to juggle a demanding college engineering curriculum with college lacrosse, a part-time job, and being vice president of my college’s Society of Women Engineers chapter; and I didn’t when I realized I wanted to change direction in my career. For as important as hard work, teamwork, and methodical thought are, they would be nothing without an innate desire to do. That is what sets me apart from others—the propensity to not only recognize what needs to be accomplished but the willingness to dig my heels in and get it done. That’s tenacity, and that’s what I have.`,
