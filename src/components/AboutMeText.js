const AboutMeText = `
Through my mechanical engineering education I developed excellent problem solving and analytical skills. While working as a marketing analyst, I was able to improve my programming ability until I was asked to enter a software engineering mentorship by one of the companyâ€™s engineering leads. Although previously my experience was predominately in Python and C, I quickly learned React/React Native. I moved to the engineering team after completing several projects including: creating a property flyer automation program written in Python/Flask that enabled the marketing team to quickly market new properties, an app built with React Native that allowed implementation managers to monitor the build-out progress of properties, and several analytical dashboards built in Tableau and Looker using custom SQL queries.
