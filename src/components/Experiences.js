          After graduating college with a degree in mechanical engineering, I
          knew I wanted to work in analytics. It was while I was working as a
          marketing analyst focused on business intelligence that I realized I
          really wanted to expand into programming. I found a mentor in Knotelâ€™s
          engineering department, who gave me my first project. At night and
          over weekends, I worked to improve my programming skills. A few more
          projects for the engineering department, and I was able to officially
          join them.
